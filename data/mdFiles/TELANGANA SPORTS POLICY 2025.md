TELANGANA SPORTS POLICY 2025

Sri A. Revanth Reddy - Hon\'ble Chief Minister of Telangana

I am a passionate sports lover. I used to be a serious football player
and play the game recreationally even now. Coincidentally, within a few
months of my government assuming office in Telangana, we had the Paris
Olympics in which our country\'s performance was quite underwhelming.
From my state of Telangana also, about a dozen athletes in different
disciplines went to Paris but unfortunately none of them could secure a
medal. When we see countries and regions far less populous than us and
with far smaller economies than ours doing well, it really saddens my
heart to see the sub-par performance of India. And this is not the first
time that we are witnessing this underperformance - it happens Olympics
after Olympics. We lament for a few months, fingers are pointed,
accusations are made, explanations are given, and then everything gets
back to normal.

I am of the firm belief that one of the main reasons why India hasn\'t
emerged as a sporting nation like so many other countries, is because
sports is treated like any other government department with its own
bureaucratic way of administration. I want to transform sports
administration in Telangana by completely freeing it from government
control. Across the world, and in our own country also, there are many
examples of private sector, charity foundations and eminent
sportspersons with a proven track record of creating amazing success
stories in the promotion of sports. I will endeavour to replicate the
same in Telangana. The role of the government will be confined to
supporting private initiatives to further their efforts.

My aim is to focus on all the critical elements that make up a
comprehensive sports ecosystem. We will encourage private enterprises to
set up world standard training academies in a hub and spoke model. To
create a pipeline of talent for the state and the country, the
government has decided to set up the Young India Physical Education and
Sports University of Telangana (YIPESU). We will also take up a
grassroots talent scouting programme in a structured and scientific
manner. The government will remain committed to encouraging our
sportspersons to realize their maximum potential by giving complete
support at the right time in the form of equipment, coaching, exposure
to national and international competitions, etc. We will also reward our
sportspersons, coaches and support staff when they bring laurels to our
state.

\"Telangana Rising\', the state\'s visionary concept, aims to be fully
realized by 2050, encompassing multifaceted development across all
sectors. As part of this mission, improving the sports ecosystem is
pivotal to laying a strong foundation for holistic growth and creating
opportunities for future generations. The Telangana region, which has
been a separate state since 2014 is known for its sporting excellence
across many disciplines in the past. After the formation of Telangana
state, sports didn\'t get its due from the government as it deserved.
However, I am confident that the transformative reforms that I am
ushering now will revive the glory of Telangana as a sporting powerhouse
within a short span of time. I look forward to the wholehearted
cooperation and support of all the stakeholders to make the Telangana
sports policy a model for the entire world.

Sri Vakiti Srihari - Hon\'ble Minister for Sports and Youth Services

I consider myself truly fortunate that within days of assuming office as
the Minister for Sports and Youth Services, the new Sports Policy has
been approved. It is a rare privilege to be entrusted with the
responsibility of implementing such a landmark framework. I sincerely
thank our Hon\'ble Chief Minister for his visionary leadership, under
which significant strides have already been made in strengthening the
sports sector in our state. This policy marks a decisive step forward
and I pledge my full commitment to its execution.

This policy is rooted in the right priorities such as talent
development, athlete welfare, skilling, and coaching excellence. Often,
policies get caught up in processes, sidelining the very people they aim
to serve. But this document keeps the sportsperson, whether emerging or
elite, at the heart of every decision. It rightly emphasizes grassroots
scouting, scientific training, career pathways, and incentives that
truly reward performance and effort. I believe this approach will create
an environment where athletes, coaches, and institutions can all thrive.

As someone who once aspired to compete at the highest levels, I deeply
understand the joys and challenges that mark an athlete\'s journey.
During my youth, I trained relentlessly to sharpen my skills, but was
compelled to leave the state in search of better facilities that simply
weren\'t available here at that time. This experience taught me a
valuable lesson: talent and dedication alone are insufficient if the
systems that support them lack fairness, transparency, and a clear
athlete-centric focus. As Minister, I am committed to building a system
that recognizes merit, rewards hard work, and nurtures every aspiring
sportsperson without bias, ensuring that Telangana becomes a state where
sporting excellence thrives.

Background: Sports in Telangana

Sports play a vital role in shaping the physical, social, and economic
fabric of a nation Like India. It fosters individual well-being by
promoting health, fitness, and personal discipline, while also creating
social harmony by uniting people across diverse regions and cultures. On
a broader scale, sporting success brings national pride and
international recognition. The spirit of competition, teamwork, and
resilience cultivated through sports not only enhances societal cohesion
but also drives economic growth through infrastructure development, job
creation, and tourism. Given these far-reaching benefits, it is crucial
for India to nurture and promote sports at every level to create a
thriving, dynamic society.

Telangana is uniquely positioned to lead the way in sports development,
setting a model for other states to replicate. With its rich sporting
legacy, particularly in cricket, football, badminton, and tennis, the
State has established a strong foundation for future growth. Hyderabad,

2007 Military World Games, 2009 World Badminton Championships, 2009 IBSF
World Snooker Championship, 2024 Intercontinental Cup (Football), and
2024 Santosh Trophy highlighting its capability in organizing
large-scale sports events.Telangana also serves as a regular venue for
international cricket and recently hosted multiple matches during the
ICC Men\'s Cricket World Cup 2023. Furthermore, the stateregularly hosts
fixturesfromannual flagship leagues such as the Indian Premier League
(IPL), Indian Super League (ISL), and Pro-Kabaddi League (PKL),

across government, private sector, and civil society facilitating
investment, innovation, and coordinated action at all levels of sport
development.

Inclusive and Equitable Access: Focused initiatives for women,
para-athletes, and underrepresented communities - alongside simplified
access schemes and dedicated support will ensure that sports are
accessible, equitable, and representative

Embedded Physical Literacy in Education and Society: Integrating sports
and values-based physical education into schools, colleges, and
community programmes will foster lifelong participation, promote

state.

The Sports Hub shall foster a thriving sports ecosystem by creating
enabling conditions for diverse stakeholders to collaborate, invest, and
operate across all levels of sport development in the state:

1\. Promoting Social Development, Cohesion and Inclusion through Sports

Telangana will prioritize access to sports and physical activity to
promote health, well-being, and social inclusion across all
demographics. Citizens will be encouraged to stay active, support
athletes, and participate in sports as a lifelong pursuit. As part of
this, a state-wide campaign will promote at least 30 minutes of daily
physical activity for every individual. A participatory framework will
engage civil society, private sector, and communities to co-create
flexible models aligned with the State\'s socio-cultural context and
leveraging sports for broader socio-economic development.

2\. Awareness and Outreach

The Government of Telangana will use digital platforms to promote sports
participation and its benefits, organizing outreach programmes to reach
remote and underserved areas. Partnerships with prominent sports figures
will engage the public through statewide campaigns, encouraging
participation in sports and physical activity for all. Additionally,
regional sports festivals and community games will showcase local talent
and foster greater community involvement, embedding a culture of active
participation and appreciation for sports across Telangana.

3\. Active Schools and Higher Education Institutions-Advancing Physical
Literacy

The Department of Sports and Youth Advancement, in collaboration with
the Department of Education and YIPESU, will embed physical literacy and
sports into the core of school and college education.Sports will be
mandatory for every student, regardless of background, and it will be
ensured that schools prioritizephysical education by providing regular
classes that introduce students to a wide range of sports.A curriculum
rooted in sport pedagogy and values-based learning - aligned with the
Olympic philosophy of holistic education - will be implemented to
promote life skills, well-being, and lifelong participation in physical
activity.

To ensure equitable access, sports kits comprising basic equipment and
apparel (Sports in a Box) will be distributed to schools in socially,
economically and geographically disadvantaged areas. Students
demonstrating sporting excellence will be given additional tailored
academic support to mitigate any learning gap. Furthermore, sports
achievements will be formally recognized on students\' Pass
Certificates, ensuring that sports are meaningfully integrated into
mainstream education.

With the support of YIPESU, measures will also be taken to improve the
quality of Physical Education Teachers (PETs). Where physical education
teachers are unavailable, community volunteers (from local athletes and
trained youth) will be engaged to support sports activities in the
schools. In case the schools do not have sports infrastructure, local
playfields will be made available to them.

4\. Sports Inclusivity

Inclusivity in sports will be ensured by making facilities accessible to
all, regardless of age, caste, race, gender, or ability. Para-athletes
and individuals with intellectual disabilities will receive focused
support through dedicated training, equipment access, and competition
pathways. An \'Easy Access Scheme\' will simplify documentation and
procedural requirements for para-athletes. Further, Women\'s
participation will be actively promoted through media visibility, Women
Sports Ambassadors, and dedicated training programmes. YIPESU will also
offer leadership training to former female athletes, supporting
alternate careers post-retirement.

5\. Sports Industry-Manufacturing, Technology, Medicine and Tourism

Telangana aims to become a national leader in sports manufacturing,
technology, medicine, and tourism. To support this vision, the state
will establish a manufacturing special zone for sports goods in the
state. Telangana will also foster sports-tech innovation by supporting
startups developing cutting-edge solutions in performance analytics,
biomechanics, fan engagement, broadcasting, and other relevant fields.
Parallelly, the state will also create a comprehensive ecosystem for
sports medicine in partnership with hospitals and medical colleges.
Additionally, local sports and adventure tourism will be promoted
through regular events, startup incentives, tax benefits, and strategic
public-private partnerships.

In Telangana, the LTAD model is adapted to broaden access and
participation, with equal focus on encouraging girls and women to enter,
stay, and thrive in sports. Focus will be given to identifying and
developing proven talent as well as potential talent. It also integrates
academic and career support to help athletes balance education with
training. Regular fitness and skill assessments will personalize
training based on each athlete\'s stage, skill level, and goals.
Additionally, aStateSports Repository, to be developed and maintained by
SATG and YISA, will track progress and guide athletes through each LTAD
stage.

Key Components of LTAD Framework in Telangana include:

1\. Sports Schools:

Currently, there are three government-run residential sports schools in
Telangana that play a critical role in the early identification and
nurturing of athletic talent: the Telangana Government Sports School in
Hakimpet, the Telangana Government Sports School in Adilabad, and the
Regional Sports School in Karimnagar. These institutions cater to
children aged 6 to 17 and provide an integrated model of education and
sports training. Students follow a structured routine with sports
sessions in the morning and evening, and academic classes during the
day. They are trained in identified sports disciplines and provided with
a protein-rich diet to support their physical development. Selection to
these schools is based on a rigorous process that includes a battery of
technical tests to ensure that only those with high potential are
admitted.

To expand access and enhance the state\'s athletic development
ecosystem, it is proposed that one sports school be established in each
erstwhile districtin a phased manner, including a dedicated sports
school for encouraging tribal students. These new and existing schools
will serve as feeder institutions to YIPESU, with a focus on identifying
and developing high-potential athletes from a young age. Collaboration
with YIPESU will be initiated for the development of a sports-related
curriculum and provision of high-performance training modules. Each
student will be trained in two sports-one individual and one team
sport-allowing for flexibility and specialization as they progress. To
enable this vision, increased funding will be allocated to both current
and proposed schools to support advanced training, recruitment of
top-tier coaches and faculty, and expansion of training and residential
infrastructure.

2\. School-level Talent Identification a Identification and Residential
School Sport Academies:

Schools are the most effective starting point for cultivating a culture
of sporting culture among children. They offer a natural setting to
introduce sports early, promote well-being, and identify young talent.
The state believes in the principle that every student should have the
opportunity to play, and those with aptitude will be supported further.

SATG, in collaboration with the Education Department, will establish
specialized residential school sport academiesat select existing
institutions under the Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational
Institutions (TSWREIS), Telangana Tribal Welfare Residential Educational
Institutions (TTWREIS), Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Telangana Backward Classes
Welfare Residential Educational Institutions (MJPTBCWREIS), and
Telangana Minorities Residential Educational Institutions (TMREIS).
These academies will be equipped with qualified coaches, dedicated
training schedules, and upgraded sports infrastructure tailored to the
identified sport disciplines.

There will be a school-based physical assessment (battery of tests)
conducted for all school going children in the state using common
measuring parameters, in line with Khelo India Rising Talent
Identification 3.0 (KIRTI 3.0). Students from across the state showing
potential in specific sports will be relocated to these schools, where
they will receive focused training and development support. These
selected students will form institutional teams and regularly
participate in matches and tournaments to build competitive experience.
Special emphasis will be placed on nutrition and fitness, with a
separate budget allocated for balanced diets, scientific training
regimes, and participation in district, state, and national-level
events. To ensure that students do not fall behind academically, they
will also receive supplementary academic coaching customized to their
learning needs. This holistic model aims to create an environment where
talented students can thrive both on the field and in the classroom,
laying the foundation for future sporting and academic success.

To ensure regular evaluation of infrastructure quality, sports
facilities, coaching standards in Residential School Sports Academies,
and levels of student participation across educational institutions, a
dedicated monitoring committee will be established.

3\. Centers of Excellence (CoEs):

The state shall also aspire to establish Center of Excellences (CoE) for
key sports with support fromKhelo India scheme, Government of India and

and the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (MYAS), further promoting
sports development in the state.

Incorporating traditional sports in the state, such as kabaddi, into
formal competitions will help preserve local culture and add diversity
to sports engagement across the State.

Pillar 4 - Infrastructure

Infrastructure Growth for Athlete Development: Phased and balanced
expansion

of network of sports institutions to support athlete development from
grassroots to elite levels, using PPP models for long-term
sustainability and efficient management.

Enhanced Accessibility and Inclusivity: Establish state-of-the-art
facilities

following inclusive and active design principles, ensuring universal
accessibility and safety.

Infrastructure development is a central priority for the State to
realize its vision of sporting excellence and foster a vibrant sports
culture. The planned infrastructure includes stadiums, training
facilities, athlete-centric educational institutions, sports complexes,
and community playfields. These facilities are essential to expanding
access to sports, providing world-class training environments, and
enabling the hosting of competitions at various levels across the State.

High-quality sports infrastructure will be established across various
regions in Telangana, aligning with the government\'s vision of
positioning the state as a national leader in sports. These modern
facilities aim not only to enhance the quality of infrastructure but
also to establish Telangana as a premier destination for hosting
national and international sporting events. In addition to upgrading
existing facilities, the Sports Hub of Telangana will create new
infrastructure in phases, based on the popularity of specific sports
across the State.

1\. Development and Integration of Institutions for Structured Athlete
Development

The State will implement an integrated and regionally balanced plan to
optimize core sports infrastructure across the State. This plan will
ensure alignment, accessibility, and efficient utilization of facilities
to support athlete development at all levels. Key infrastructure
components will include YIPESU, YISA Hub and Spokes, Sports Schools,
Residential School Sport Academies, Sports Science Centers /
Laboratories, Centers of Excellence, as well as various village-and
community-level facilities.

Mini stadiums are being developed in all 119 Assembly Constituencies in
the state for development of sporting culture across all regions, some
of which have already been constructed. These facilities will serve as
local hubs for community engagement, youth participation, and grassroots
talent development. In urban centers, especially Hyderabad, the
government will prioritize renovation of existing as well as development
of new high-quality, multipurpose stadiums to meet the growing demand
for professional and spectator-friendly infrastructure.

2\. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) for Sustainable Infrastructure
Development

Existing sports facilities across the State face several persistent
challenges, including inadequate maintenance, budgetary limitations,
underutilization, absence of premium services, ageing technology, as
well as unsustainable operating models. To address these issues
comprehensively, the State will adopt PPP as a strategic mechanism to
enhance and expand sports infrastructure. PPP models offer the
opportunity to leverage private sector expertise, investment, and
operational capabilities, while safeguarding public ownership,and
long-term community benefit. Two primary models will be adopted based on
the nature and scale of the facility:

Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Contracts will enable private entities
to manage existing facilities for a fixed duration, with the government
retaining ownership. This will improve efficiency, enhance service
quality, and reduce the administrative burden on the public sector. This
model suits mini stadiums and mid-scale infrastructure that require
streamlined management and better upkeep.

Lease-Develop-Operate (LDO) Infrastructure Model will allow a private
partner to lease the government-owned facilities, undertake necessary
infrastructure upgrades or new development, and operate the facility
over a concession period. The private entity will assume responsibility
for development, maintenance, and revenue generation, while the
government maintains ownership and oversight. This model will primarily
be used for capital-intensive projects includingworld-class stadiums in
Hyderabad.

To enhance financial sustainability and encourage private participation,
all PPP-developed venues will be granted preferred venue status for
hosting government and official events.For commercial viability, up to
30% of the site potential will be allocated for non-sporting or
commercial activities. It will be ensured that all facilities developed
under these models remain accessible to a wide range of users, from
grassroots to elite athletes.

3\. Accessible and Inclusive Infrastructure

All facilities will be developed based on principles of sustainability,
with attention to environmental impact, safety, universal accessibility,
and adaptability to both multi-sport and sport-specific training needs.
Measures such as flexible operating hours, improved security, and
lighting will enhance usability among diverse user groups.Additionally,
dedicated time slots will be reserved in facilitiesfor training of
para-athletes.

4\. State Sports Infrastructure Repository

SATG, in collaboration with technology partners and aggregator
platforms, will establish and maintain a State Sports Infrastructure
Repository (similar to the State Sports Repository for athletes,
coaches, and personnel). This system will leverage Geographic
Information System (GIS) technology to visually map all sports
facilities across the state, including stadiums, mini-stadiums, training
centers, and multipurpose halls. The platform will feature real-time
booking capabilities to streamline facility usage, prevent overbooking,
and promote equitable access. In addition, the repository will support
facility condition monitoring, including maintenance tracking and
accessibility checks.

Pillar 5 - Skills Development and Career Pathways

Sustainable Career Pathways: Establishing structured career pathways and
post-retirement support for athletes and coaches, ensuring long-term
employment and opportunities in sports.

Professional Excellence and Skill Advancement: Tailor edup skilling and
reskilling programmes to equip current as well as retired athletes for
diverse career opportunities.

The State envisions skill development within and through sports. The
government is committed to fostering a skilled sports workforce by
providing specialized training, upskilling and reskilling opportunities
for sports personnel. Additionally, the government aims to create
sustainable career pathways in sports through targeted employment
initiatives, incentives, and support for career transitions, especially
for retired athletes.

1\. Upskilling and Re-skilling of Athletes:

As athletes invest most of their time in training and taking part in
competitions, they often fall behind in terms of achieving the same
level of skills as non-athletes in the general workforce. To bridge this
gap and enable the athletes to pursue a second/alternative career, the
State will establish a structured framework for upskilling and
re-skilling. This will include different programmes for currentas well
as retired athletesbased on their background, including:

Career-Ready Skill Development: Industry-aligned training programs to
build

functional, technical, and soft skills relevant to the wider workforce.
This includes communication, leadership, and personality development.
Tailored skilling tracks will be provided at the Young India Skills
University (YISU), with dedicated employment drives for program
graduates.

Pathways for Continued Education and Certification: Bridge courses and
flexible

academic entry points along with fee incentives will be offered for
athletes who wish to re-enter formal education. Degree programs at YISU
and YIPESU will cater to different backgrounds, varied learning needs,
including separate options for elite athletes and those previously
deprived of formal education.

Post-Retirement Integration into Sports Ecosystem: Veteran sportspersons
will be encouraged to pursue roles such as coaches, instructors, or
technical staff. YIPESU will offer specialized practical and refresher
courses to prepare them for these roles, ensuring their continued
contribution to the sports ecosystem.

2\. Livelihoods and Career Pathways:

SATG will create and update guidelines to provide employment
opportunities for athletes who have achieved significant success in the
Olympics, World Championships, World Cups, Asian Games, Commonwealth
Games, and other similar competitions, on a case-by-case basis. This
also includes recipients of prestigious awards like the Padma Bhushan,
Padma Vibhushan, Dronacharya Award, Khel Ratna, and Arjuna Award.

A sportsperson-oriented recruitment scheme will be introduced by the
Government. A sportsperson-oriented scheme for admissions in Higher
Educational Institutions will also be introduced.

Provisions for Special Casual Leave / On Duty will be enhanced for
sportspersons, coaches, support staff, technical officials, and
selectors.

3\. Pension for Retired Athletes and Coaches:

Pension support will be provided to veteran meritorious athletes and
coaches. Such veterans will also be encouraged and supported to
transition into various sport related assignments, mentor and share
their knowledge, experiences, and insights with younger athletes, and
contribute to the development of a strong coaching ecosystem.

Resource and Monitoring Plan

The Resource and Monitoring Plan establishes a sustainable framework for
financing, managing, and evaluating Telangana\'s sports initiatives.
Through diversified funding mechanisms, private sector partnerships, and
a strong emphasis on accountability, the State will support both
grassroots and high-performance sports while ensuring that resources are
transparently allocated. This plan includes provisions for dedicated
athlete support, community engagement, and recognition of contributors,
fostering an inclusive and robust sports ecosystem across the State.
Emphasis is given to simplifying procedures and leveraging technology to
enhance transparency.

The Sports Hub of Telangana will oversee the implementation process of
the policy, and the allocation and utilization of funds. It will,
itself, or through the constitution of appropriate Monitory and
Evaluation (M&E) committee conduct reviews at the 1-year, 3-year, and
5-year milestones, and amendments to the policy will be made accordingly
based on the outcomes of these reviews. The Sports Hub and the State
will aim to also host regular conclaves, summits, and stakeholder
consultations to ensure ongoing dialogue among sports experts,
administrators, athletes, and policy makers. These events will review
policy progress, gather insights on emerging challenges, and allow for
periodic updates, ensuring the policy remains aligned with current needs
and global best practices.

1\. Mobilizing Funds for Sports Development

1.1. Telangana Sports Development Fund (TSDF)

The fund will receive contributions from various sources, including
State government grants, funding from Overseas Citizens of India (OCI),
MP/MLA Local Area Development (LAD) schemes, rental fees on sporting
infrastructure in the state, Central government funds through programmes
like Khelo India and other related schemes, as well as Corporate Social
Responsibility (CSR) funding. This diversified funding approach will
ensure the sustainability and growth of the Sports Hub of Telangana\'s
objectives. The Sports Hub of Telangana will oversee the fund.

1.2. Sports Fund at District-level

10% of the Crucial Balance Fund (CBF) available with District Collectors
will be earmarked for sports development in the respective districts
every year henceforth.

A digital platform will be developed to track TSDF fund inflows and
disbursements, ensuring transparency and accountability. Each
contribution will be mapped to specific initiatives, including
infrastructure, scholarships, and grassroots programmes, to provide
clear oversight of fund utilization.

2\. Support for Competitive and High-Performance Sports

2.1. Support to Elite Athletes and Coaches

The Government of Telangana will provide financial and non-financial
support to elite athletes, including para-athletes and special athletes,
as well as their coaches.

The government will establish the following committees to manage the
allocation of financial support:

Scrutiny Committee (5-member): Chaired by the MD of SATG, with
representatives from the Technical Division, Associations,
Administration, and Telangana Olympic Association (TOA). This committee
will conduct initial scrutiny and evaluation of applications.

Approval Committee (12-member): Chaired by the Hon\'ble Minister for
Sports, this committee includes the Chairman of SATG, Secretary of
Sports, MD of SATG, a Finance Department representative, four
association representatives (on rotation), President / Secretary of TOA,
and two eminent sportspersons. This committee is responsible for
approving cash incentives, Out-of-Pocket Allowance (OPA), and
scholarships.

The committee shall be mandated to authorize and make guidelines for
financial assistance to all established athletes and teams in the state.
Athletes will be classified into performance-based tiers based on
results in national and international competitions, enabling tailored
incentives for each level. Financial assistance shall include two
components: Allowance for diet, kit (including apparel and equipment),
training (including international training in select cases),
participation in national and international events, travel and
sustenance, along with an additional component based on the
individual\'s performance. The Approval Committee will also decide on
any employment to be provided to top athletes, on a case-by-case basis.

Alongside established performers, the Government will ensure that
emerging talent is also systematically identified and supported. The
SATG, in coordination with respective sports associations, will compile
a list of potential athletes in each sport, with the number of such
players set at approximately 30% of the established talent pool. These
identified athletes will receive proportionate financial and
administrative support to nurture their development. Winners of the CM
Cup (State Level), Khelo India Youth Games, and Khelo India School Games
will be rewarded for a minimum of one year following their medal
achievement. The continuation of incentives will be performance-based
and subject to annual review, ensuring sustained support for consistent
performers.

Additionally, out-of-pocket allowances and scholarships will be provided
for athletes pursuing education, in collaboration with YIPESU and other
universities, supporting both their athletic and academic growth.

A three-tier structure-with Elite, Emerging, and Foundation
Categories-will be created for coaches based on qualification,
experience, results delivered, past awards etc. Rewards and financial
incentives will be accordingly provisioned for the three categories of
coaches.

2.2. Assistance to Recognized State Sports Associations

The State will provide financial assistance to recognized state sports
associations to support their efficient operation and promote sports
development at all levels. Funding will support the organization of
competitions, grassroots programmes, and talent development initiatives
across taluka, mandal, district, state, national, and international
levels. Only associations recognized by their respective National
Federations and compliant with the National Sports Development Code 2011
will qualify for assistance. This decentralized funding approach will
build local sports capacity and encourage regional engagement.

3\. Incentives and Felicitation of Athletes and Coaches
